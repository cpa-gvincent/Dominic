JD Realty — Static Website
==========================

This is a simple static real-estate website (HTML/CSS/JS) created from the provided mockup.

How to use (locally)
--------------------
1. Unzip the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Deploy to GitHub Pages
----------------------
1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Commit these files to the repository's `main` branch.
3. In the repository Settings -> Pages, select the `main` branch and root folder `/` to publish.
4. GitHub Pages will provide a public URL (usually https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/).

Or deploy from the command line:
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial site"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO>.git
git push -u origin main
```

If you'd like, I can also generate a React (Vite) project or a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy automatically — tell me which you prefer.
